# NETWORK CONNECTIONS
An applied algorithm of the six degrees of separation theory

## What's the six degrees of separation theory ?

The six degrees of separation theory, also known as the six handshakes rule is a theory which said that all people in the world are six of fewer social connections between them. So, a person A is connected to any person B in the world by a maximum of six relations (because of a friend of a friend of a friend... who knows the person B).

## Application of the theory

The goal of this project is to use the power of social networks to determine the minimal chain to connect people. Nowadays, using modern tools and social networks, it has been shown that we are about five connections away from any person in the world instead of six (that's still an average).

Using Facebook or Instagram APIs we may be able to create an automated script for that.
